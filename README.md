# Coffee-Machine-Simulator 

### Programming Language :
* Core Java

### How this app works :
* User will enter the type of coffee he/she needed like Espresso Latte or Cappucinno
* Then if the machine does not have the ingredient then it will ask to fill the ingrdients
* After filling ingrdients if the required amount of coffee is greater than or equal to ingredients present in machine then it will make the coffee and give to user
* In the end this machine simulator will give the analysis of how much revenue generated from each coffee and how much ingredients are consumed!

### Project Summary
This project is a coffee machine simulator that allows users to input their desired type of coffee and receive a freshly brewed cup in return. The simulator keeps track of the inventory of ingredients required to make each type of coffee, and prompts the user to refill any ingredients that are running low. Once the necessary ingredients are available, the simulator prepares the coffee and gives it to the user.

The simulator also provides an analysis of the revenue generated from each type of coffee and the amount of ingredients consumed. This feature allows the user to keep track of their inventory and ensure that they are maximizing their profits.
